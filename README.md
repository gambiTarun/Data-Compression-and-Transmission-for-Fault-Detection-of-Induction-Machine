Wireless transmission using Raspberry pi for fault detection and Diagnosis of Stator Winding Faults due to Insulation Failure in Industrial Induction Machine

## Introduction

Fault detection of Induction motors using the current signals is a growing technology to detect the fault of an induction motor. Definite harmonic signals of the line current are located by a popular method known as Motor Current Signature Analysis. The actual fault detection by using the human involvement is widely replaced by the automated technology, like an on-line condition monitoring approach. Here we implement a real-time computer-aided advanced diagnosis system comprising of feature extraction, feature selection and feature classification.
